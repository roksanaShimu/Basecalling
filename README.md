# Basecalling
This repository is an implementation of Basecalling for DNA Sequencing. Basecalling is essentially a sequence labeling problem: a time-series is
converted to a sequence of letters from the alphabet A; C; G; T. The aim of this research is
to make the conversion faster and more power efficient to enable embedded operations. I implement a GPU-enhanced sequence analyzer capable of operating in a streaming fashion.
